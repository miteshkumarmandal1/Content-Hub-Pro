# 📱 Content-Hub-Pro

**Content-Hub-Pro** is an Android reels-style application that plays videos directly from device storage in a randomized feed, promoting focused and distraction-free content consumption.

---

## 📖 Description

Content Hub Pro is a **native Android application** that replicates the smooth, immersive experience of modern reel-based apps—without internet dependency or algorithmic distractions.

Instead of pulling content from online platforms, the app plays **locally stored videos**, presenting them in a randomized reel feed. This ensures users consume only the content they intentionally saved, making the app ideal for **learning, motivation, and productivity**.

Built using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**, the app features a single optimized video player screen with vertical swipe gestures similar to popular reel platforms. Randomized playback makes each viewing session feel fresh while maintaining full user control over content.

This project focuses on **minimalism, performance, and mental well-being**, helping users reduce digital distraction and consume meaningful content.
